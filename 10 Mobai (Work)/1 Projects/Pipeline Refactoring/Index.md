# Pipeline Refactoring

## Project Goal
Refactor pad_candidate repository to be scalable for PAD, MAD, DeepFake detection, and any deep learning research model.

## Status
🟡 Planning Phase

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-10-07
- **Target Completion:** 2025-10-21
- **Deadline:** 

## Background
Current pad_candidate repo has stitched pipelines (preprocessing, training, evaluation, research bench) that work but need refactoring for better scalability.

## Scope
### In Scope
- [x] PAD (Presentation Attack Detection)
- [x] MAD (Morph Attack Detection)
- [ ] DeepFake Detection
- [x] Generic deep learning research pipeline

### Out of Scope
- Production deployment (separate task)
- Frontend changes

## Current Architecture Issues
- [ ] Tight coupling between components
- [ ] Hardcoded PAD-specific logic
- [ ] Duplicate code across pipelines
- [ ] Difficult to add new attack types
- [ ] Config management needs improvement

## Target Architecture

### Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Data loading
   - Model training
   - Evaluation
   - Experimentation

2. **Modularity**
   - Pluggable components
   - Abstract interfaces
   - Config-driven

3. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new attack types
   - Reusable components

```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Design ✏️
- [ ] Define abstract interfaces
- [ ] Design config system
- [ ] Document component interactions
- [ ] Review with team

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring 🔨
- [ ] Refactor data pipeline
- [ ] Refactor training loop
- [ ] Refactor evaluation pipeline
- [ ] Update config management

### Phase 3: Attack Type Support 🎯
- [ ] Ensure PAD still works
- [ ] Add MAD support
- [ ] Add DeepFake support
- [ ] Generic attack type interface

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation 📝
- [ ] Unit tests for components
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Migration guide

### Phase 5: PhD Pipeline Separation 🎓
- [ ] Create separate PhD pipeline
- [ ] Identical architecture
- [ ] Separate configs
- [ ] Independent experiments

## Technical Decisions

### Config System
**Decision:** Use Hydra for configuration management
**Reasoning:** 
- Hierarchical configs
- Easy overrides
- Type checking

### Code Organization
**Decision:** Modular packages with clear interfaces
**Reasoning:**
- Easy to test
- Easy to extend
- Clear dependencies

## Code & Implementation
**Repository:** pad_candidate
**Branch:** `refactor/scalable-pipeline`
**Key Files:**
- `design_doc.md`
- `architecture.md`
