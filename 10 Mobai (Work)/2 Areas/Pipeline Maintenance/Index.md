# Pipeline Maintenance - pad_candidate

## Repository Overview
Single repository with stitched pipelines:
- Preprocessing
- Training
- Evaluation (model fusion)
- Research bench (experimentation)

## Current State
Functional but needs refactoring

## Refactoring Goals
Make pipeline scalable for:
- [x] PAD (Presentation Attack Detection)
- [ ] MAD (Morph Attack Detection)
- [ ] DeepFake Detection
- [ ] Any deep learning research model

## Refactoring Roadmap
### Phase 1: Architecture Design
- [ ] Define common interfaces
- [ ] Separate concerns (data, model, training, eval)
- [ ] Design config system

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Refactor preprocessing
- [ ] Refactor training loop
- [ ] Refactor evaluation
- [ ] Refactor research bench

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Documentation
