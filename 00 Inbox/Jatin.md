# Gemini version: 
## Refined Introduction Script

"Good morning. My name is Jatin Rathore. I am a Metallurgy graduate from **NIT Nagpur**, and for the past 29 months, I have been working with **Adani Defence & Aerospace** at their Small Caliber Ammunition facility in Kanpur.

My role is quite diverse, primarily focused on three pillars:

- **Operations & Quality:** I manage the Metallurgical Lab and lead the Incoming Quality Control department, ensuring that every piece of raw material meets the rigorous standards required for defense production.
- **Strategy & Supply Chain:** I am currently working with the **Supplier Quality Assurance** team, where I handle vendor onboarding and audits. This has given me a deep understanding of how to build a resilient and high-quality supply ecosystem.
- **Compliance:** I am also a Certified Lead Auditor for Integrated Management Systems (ISO 9001, 14001, and 45001), which allows me to oversee safety and quality standards at an organizational level.

Beyond my core responsibilities, I have always stayed close to research and social impact. During my undergrad, I presented a review paper at ICMMSEIR and a poster on Additive Manufacturing at the Aero-3D conference. I also spent time with **Prayaas**, an NGO club where I taught government school students for state scholarship exams—an experience that taught me as much about empathy as it did about leadership.

I am now looking to transition into a management role to leverage this technical and supply chain foundation to solve larger business challenges."
