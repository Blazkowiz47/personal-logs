## Quick Summary
**Method:** MPFLN
- **Supervision:** Depth, BinaryMask
- **Backbone:** CDCN, 3D-CDCN
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S, D

## Abstract
A Multi-Perspective Feature Learning Network (MPFLN) is proposed to extract representative features from the perspectives of Real + Mask vs. Photo + Video and Real + Video vs. Real vs. Spoof to alleviate the decline in the discrimination of extracted features and achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.
