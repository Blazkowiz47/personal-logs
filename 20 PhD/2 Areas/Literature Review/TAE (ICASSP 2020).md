# Domain Adaptation for Generalization of Face Presentation Attack Detection in Mobile Settings with Minimal Information

> [!abstract]
> We address the problem of domain adaptation for face presentation attack detection (PAD) in mobile settings. We propose a method to improve the generalization of face PAD systems to unseen domains by leveraging minimal information from the target domain. Our approach is based on the Information Maximization Variational Autoencoder (InfoVAE), which learns a disentangled representation of the data. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques on several face PAD benchmarks.
