- **Input:** YCbCr, HSV
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Abstract
This paper proposes a novel two-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for face anti-spoofing. One stream, the **patch-based CNN**, operates on local face patches to extract texture information. The other stream, the **depth-based CNN**, estimates the depth map of the face, leveraging the fact that live faces have 3D depth while spoof faces (photos/videos) are flat. The fusion of these two streams achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.
