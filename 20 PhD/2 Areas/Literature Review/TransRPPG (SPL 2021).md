## Quick Summary
**Abstract:** (IEEE blocked - metadata unavailable) TransRPPG proposes a Vision Transformer approach for face anti-spoofing using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signal maps as input to detect presentation attacks through physiological signals.

**Method:** TransRPPG
- **Backbone:** Vision Transformer
- **Loss:** Binary CE loss
- **Input:** rPPG map
- **Static/Dynamic:** D
