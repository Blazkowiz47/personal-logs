## What does the paper present?
Traditional PAD approaches lack generalization due to limited modalities and subjects. Simple concatenation of modalities is suboptimal as not all features are equally important.

1. **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Proposes an end-to-end approach fusing RGB, Depth, and IR.
2. **Spatial and Channel Attention:** Introduces attention modules to select discriminative features spatially and across channels.
3. **Performance:** Achieves promising results on the CASIA-SURF dataset.
