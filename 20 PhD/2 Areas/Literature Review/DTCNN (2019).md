## What does the paper present?
Poor generalization across datasets due to variety of spoofing materials and environmental conditions. Limited labeled data in target domains.

1.  **Deep Transfer Learning:** Uses sparsely labeled data from the target domain to learn invariant features.
2.  **MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy):** Minimizes the distribution distance between source and target domains in the feature space.

- Cross-dataset benchmarks.

## What are my views on it?
- MMD is a standard and effective baseline for domain adaptation.

- Semi-supervised or few-shot adaptation is very practical.
