## Abstract
Face anti-spoofing is a vital step to ensure the security of face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Face Anti-Spoofing (MS-FANS) method to exploit multi-scale information for face anti-spoofing. Specifically, we design a multi-scale architecture to extract features from different scales of face images, which can capture both global semantic information and local detailed texture information. We also introduce a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on the most discriminative regions and frames. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, CASIA-FASD and Replay-Attack, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
