## Abstract
This paper proposes FGDNet (Fine-Grained Detection Network) for face anti-spoofing. It utilizes a Convolutional Transformer backbone to capture both local and global features. The "Fine-Grained" aspect refers to its ability to capture subtle discriminative cues in the frequency or spatial domain to distinguish between bona fide and attack presentations. The method employs a 5-class Cross-Entropy Loss to improve the discriminative power of the learned features.
