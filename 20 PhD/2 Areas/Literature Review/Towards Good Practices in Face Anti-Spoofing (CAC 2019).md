## What does the paper present?
**Abstract:** In this paper, a novel auto-encoder image reconstruction model is proposed to address the face anti-spoofing problem and introduces the multi-scale skip connections to excavate multi-level semantics contained in images. The proposed method utilizes an image reconstruction model to address the face anti-spoofing problem, guiding the network towards better reconstruction results.
