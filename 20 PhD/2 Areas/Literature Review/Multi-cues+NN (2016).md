> [!abstract]
> Many trait-specific countermeasures to face spoofing attacks have been developed for security of face authentication. However, there is no superior face anti-spoofing technique to deal with every kind of spoofing attack in varying scenarios. In order to improve the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing approaches, an extendable multi-cues integration framework for face anti-spoofing using a hierarchical neural network is proposed, which can fuse image quality cues and motion cues for liveness detection. Shearlet is utilized to develop an image quality-based liveness feature. Dense optical flow is utilized to extract motion-based liveness features. A bottleneck feature fusion strategy can integrate different liveness features effectively. The proposed approach was evaluated on three public face anti-spoofing databases. A half total error rate (HTER) of 0% and an equal error rate (EER) of 0% were achieved on both REPLAY-ATTACK database and 3D-MAD database. An EER of 5.83% was achieved on CASIA-FASD database.
