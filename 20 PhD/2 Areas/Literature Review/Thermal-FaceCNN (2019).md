## What does the paper present?
**Abstract:** Face Liveness Detection Using Thermal Face-CNN with External Knowledge. This paper proposes a thermal face-based CNN approach for face anti-spoofing using external knowledge from facial temperature patterns to distinguish between live faces and presentation attacks.

**Method:** Thermal-FaceCNN
