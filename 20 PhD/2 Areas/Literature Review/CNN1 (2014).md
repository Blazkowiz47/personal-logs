## Quick Summary
**Method:** CNN1 (Learn Convolutional Neural Network for Face Anti-Spoofing)
- **Backbone:** Custom CNN (likely shallow by modern standards)
- **Loss:** Binary Classification (Softmax/SVM)
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Problem Statement
Early application of CNNs to the problem of Face Anti-Spoofing, treating it as a binary classification task.

## Key Contributions
1.  **CNN for PAD:** One of the early works proposing end-to-end CNN learning for PAD.
2.  **Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP):** Introduced SPP to improve generalization and handle different input sizes.

## Methodology
### Architecture
- **CNN:** Custom architecture.
- **SPP Layer:** Added to the network.

## Experiments
### Datasets Used
- CASIA-FASD
- Replay-Attack

## Critical Analysis
### What Works Well
- Demonstrated that deep learning could outperform hand-crafted features even in 2014.

## Relevance to My Work
### Ideas Sparked
- Historical context: shows the transition from LBP/SVM to CNNs.
