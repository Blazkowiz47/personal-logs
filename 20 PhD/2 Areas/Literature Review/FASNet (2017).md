## Abstract
Face recognition systems are gaining momentum with current developments in computer vision. At the same time, tactics to mislead these systems are getting more complex, and counter-measure approaches are necessary. Following the current progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we present a transfer learning approach for the face anti-spoofing problem. We explore the use of pre-trained CNNs (VGG-Face) to extract features from face images and use them to train a classifier (SVM). We also propose a new dataset, the Unicamp Video-Attack Database (UVAD), which is composed of videos of valid accesses and attacks. Our results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the UVAD and Replay-Attack datasets.
