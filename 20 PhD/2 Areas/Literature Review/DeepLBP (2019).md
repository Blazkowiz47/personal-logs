- **Loss:** Binary CE loss, SVM
- **Input:** RGB, HSV, YCbCr
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Abstract
This paper integrates the traditional Local Binary Patterns (LBP) descriptor with deep learning techniques. Instead of using LBP as a handcrafted feature fed into a classifier, it typically uses LBP maps as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or uses a CNN to learn LBP-like texture features. The goal is to combine the texture description capability of LBP with the semantic feature learning power of deep networks to detect presentation attacks.
