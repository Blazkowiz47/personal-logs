## Quick Summary
**Method:** Echo-FAS
- **Backbone:** ResNet18, Transformer
- **Loss:** Binary CE Loss
- **Input:** RGB, Vocal
- **Fusion:** Feature-level

## Abstract
While RGB-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models have proven to counter the face spoofing attack effectively, most existing FAS models suffer from the overfitting problem to specific attacks or environments. To address this, this paper proposes a novel acoustic-based FAS system that leverages the unique acoustic signatures of face spoofing attacks. The system, named Echo-FAS, transmits an acoustic signal and analyzes the echoes reflected from the face to distinguish between live faces and spoofing attacks (e.g., masks, screens).
