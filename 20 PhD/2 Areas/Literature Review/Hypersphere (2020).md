## Quick Summary
**Method:** Hypersphere
- **Backbone:** ResNet18
- **Loss:** Hypersphere loss
- **Input:** RGB, HSV

## Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of detecting unseen presentation attacks (attacks not present in the training set) by proposing a new loss function, the "Hypersphere Loss," which aims to learn a more compact and discriminative representation for genuine faces, pushing attacks (both seen and unseen) away from the genuine center in the feature space.
