## Abstract
Reflection differences between live faces and spoof faces under near-infrared spectrum make near-infrared image based methods obtain superior performance for face anti-spoofing. However, for conventional face recognition systems, near-infrared image based methods need additional near-infrared equipment to capture the input near-infrared images. In this paper, we propose a novel face anti-spoofing method which exploits the clues in both visible light (VIS) images and near-infrared (NIR) images without utilizing any near-infrared equipment during testing. Specifically, we first propose a novel multiple categories image translation generative adversarial network (MCT-GAN) which generates corresponding NIR images for VIS live and spoof face images. Then we utilize convolution neural network to learn fusing features from both VIS images and corresponding generated NIR images for the goal of live and spoof face classification. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method obtains excellent results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
