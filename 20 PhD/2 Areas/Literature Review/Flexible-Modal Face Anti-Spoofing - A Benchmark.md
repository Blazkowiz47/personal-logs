## Quick Summary
Train a "One-for-all" model on RGB+Depth+Infrared modalities with a single backbone and three feature fusion strategies.

## Problem Statement
What problem does this paper address?
Developing a single model which can be deployed flexibly with different modalities.

## Key Contributions
1. First flexible-modal benchmark.
2. Cross-attention fusion module to efficiently mine cross-modal clues for flexible-modal deployment.
3. Found out that the modality dropout strategy works well in flex-modal intra-testings but poorly in flex-modal cross-testings.
