# On Disentangling Spoof Trace for Generic Face Anti-Spoofing

> [!abstract]
> Prior studies show that the key to face anti-spoofing lies in the subtle image pattern, termed "spoof trace", e.g., color distortion, 3D mask edge, Moire pattern, and many others. Designing a generic anti-spoofing model to estimate those spoof traces can improve not only the generalization of the spoof detection, but also the interpretability of the model's decision. Yet, this is a challenging task due to the diversity of spoof types and the lack of ground truth in spoof traces. This work designs a novel adversarial learning framework to disentangle the spoof traces from input faces as a hierarchical combination of patterns at multiple scales. With the disentangled spoof traces, we unveil the live counterpart of the original spoof face, and further synthesize realistic new spoof faces after a proper geometric correction. Our method demonstrates superior spoof detection performance on both seen and unseen spoof scenarios while providing visually convincing estimation of spoof traces.
