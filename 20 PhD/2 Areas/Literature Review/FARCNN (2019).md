- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Abstract
The paper presents a novel approach for face anti-spoofing (FARCNN) that fuses information from both the frequency domain (using Fourier or similar transforms) and the spatial domain using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This dual-domain approach aims to capture both the textural details (spatial) and the noise/blur artifacts (frequency) common in spoofing attacks like print or replay.
