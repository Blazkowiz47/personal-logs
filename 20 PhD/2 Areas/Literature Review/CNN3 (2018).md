## What does the paper present?
Developing a computationally efficient, end-to-end CNN for PAD that can be deployed on mobile devices.

1.  **End-to-End Architecture:** Maps raw images directly to liveness scores without complex preprocessing or hand-crafted features.
2.  **Efficiency:** Designed for mobile deployment.

## What are my views on it?
- Simplicity and efficiency are key for practical applications.

- End-to-end learning is the standard now, but efficiency remains a challenge.
