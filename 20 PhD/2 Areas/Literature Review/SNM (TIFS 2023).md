# Attention-Aware Dual-Stream Network for Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing

> [!abstract]
> As a closely related topic, multimodal face anti-spoofing (FAS) has become an indispensable part of face recognition systems. However, existing multimodal FAS tools suffer from performance degradation under external low-lighting conditions and the lack of effective fusion strategies. To address these issues, we propose an Attention-Aware Dual-Stream Network (ADSN) for multimodal FAS. Specifically, we first design a dual-stream network to extract features from RGB and IR/Depth modalities. Then, we introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the features from different modalities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
