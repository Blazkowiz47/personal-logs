## What does the paper present?
To be applicable to unconstrained real-world environments, FAS methods require robust generalization capabilities. This paper aims to improve generalization to unseen environments by guiding networks to learn generalizable features.

1.  **Bipartite Auxiliary Supervision:** Suggests using bipartite auxiliary supervision to properly guide networks.
2.  **BASN Architecture:** Proposes the Bipartite Auxiliary Supervision Network (BASN) that comprehensively utilizes the suggested supervision.
3.  **Generalization:** Demonstrates robust generalization ability to unseen environments.

-   Public benchmark datasets (likely OULU-NPU, SiW, etc.)

-   Achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets.
-   Shows improved generalization.
