## Abstract
This paper proposes a deep learning method based on color texture features for face anti-spoofing. The authors analyze the effectiveness of different color spaces (RGB, HSV, and YCbCr) in distinguishing between bona fide and spoof faces. They design a specific Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn deep features from these color spaces, demonstrating that color texture information is crucial for robust spoofing detection.
