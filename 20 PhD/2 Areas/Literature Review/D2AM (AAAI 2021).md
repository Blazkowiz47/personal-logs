## What does the paper present?
Existing DG methods assume known domain labels. Real-world data has mixture domains with unknown labels.

1.  **Mixture Domain DG:** Addresses the problem where domain labels are unknown.
2.  **D2AM:** Domain Dynamic Adjustment Meta-learning. Iteratively divides mixture domains via discriminative domain representation.
3.  **DRLM:** Domain Representation Learning Module using Instance Normalization (IN).

- Standard cross-domain protocols.

## What are my views on it?
- Handling unknown domain labels is a significant step towards "in the wild" generalization.

- Unsupervised domain discovery is a powerful concept.
