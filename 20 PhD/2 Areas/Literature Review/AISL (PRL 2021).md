# Topological phenomena demonstrated in photorefractive photonic lattices (AISL?)

> **Note:** The file name "AISL" seems to be a mismatch with the paper found at the URL provided (`https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16147`). The paper at this URL is titled **"Topological phenomena demonstrated in photorefractive photonic lattices"** and is about **Optics/Physics**, not Face Anti-Spoofing.

> **Correction:** I will search for the correct "AISL" paper (likely "Adversarial Image Synthesis Learning" or similar) in the next step. For now, I am flagging this note as a mismatch.

## What does the paper present?
**(Content below refers to the mismatched Optics paper found at the URL)**
This paper reviews work on topological phenomena in photorefractive photonic lattices.
