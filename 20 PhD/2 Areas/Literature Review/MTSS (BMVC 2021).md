## Quick Summary
**Method:** MTSS
- **Backbone:** ViT+Multi-Level Attention Module
- **Loss:** CE Loss
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Abstract
A new Multi-Teacher Single-Student (MTSS) visual Transformer with a multi-level attention design is proposed with a novel Multi-Level Attention Module with a DropBlock (MAMD) designed to strengthen discriminative features while dropping irrelevant spatial features to avoid overfitting.
