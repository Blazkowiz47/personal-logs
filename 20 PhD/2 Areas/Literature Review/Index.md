# Literature Review

> **Quick Access:** [[Papers Database|ðŸ“š View All Papers]] | [[Paper Reading Workflow|ðŸ“– How to Use This System]]

## Overview
This area tracks all academic papers, research findings, and literature relevant to my PhD research in biometric security and presentation attack detection.

## Papers Database
The [[Papers Database]] contains all papers organized by:
- **Status** (To Read, Reading, Read)
- **Topic** (PAD, MAD, DeepFake, etc.)
- **Venue** (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, Journals)
- **Year**
- **Priority**

### Quick Stats
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	status as "Status",
	length(rows) as "Count"
FROM "20 PhD/2 Areas/Literature Review"
WHERE contains(tags, "paper")
GROUP BY status
SORT status DESC
```

### Recently Read Papers
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	file.link as "Paper",
	dateread as "Date Read"
FROM "20 PhD/2 Areas/Literature Review"
WHERE contains(tags, "paper") AND status = "âœ… Read"
SORT dateread DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## Research Topics
- **Presentation Attack Detection (PAD)** - Core PhD focus
- **Morph Attack Detection (MAD)** - Related to face manipulation
- **DeepFake Detection** - Synthetic face detection
- **Face Anti-Spoofing** - General term for PAD
- **Cross-Modal Learning** - Multi-modal approaches
- **Domain Generalization** - Generalization across domains
