# Who Make Drivers Stop? Towards Driver-centric Risk Assessment (AIM-FAS?)

> **Note:** The file name "AIM-FAS" seems to be a mismatch with the paper found at the URL provided in the original note (`https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02425`). The paper at this URL is titled **"Who Make Drivers Stop? Towards Driver-centric Risk Assessment: Risk Object Identification via Causal Inference"** and is about autonomous driving/robotics, not Face Anti-Spoofing.

> **Correction:** I will search for the correct "AIM-FAS" paper (likely "Zero-Shot Face Anti-Spoofing" or similar from AAAI 2020) in the next step. For now, I am flagging this note as a mismatch.

## What does the paper present?
**(Content below refers to the mismatched driving paper found at the URL)**
This paper proposes a driver-centric definition of risk and a causal inference framework for identifying risk objects in driving scenes.
