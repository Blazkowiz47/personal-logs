## Quick Summary
**Method:** FCN-LSA
- **Supervision:** BinaryMask (Local Ternary Label)
- **Backbone:** DepthNet
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Abstract
This paper proposes a method for face spoofing detection using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). It introduces a novel "Local Ternary Label Supervision" strategy to guide the network to learn more discriminative features, likely utilizing pixel-wise supervision (e.g., distinguishing between live skin, spoof medium, and background) to improve performance against various attack types.
