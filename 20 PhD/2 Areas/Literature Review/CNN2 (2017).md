## Quick Summary
**Method:** CNN2 (Performance Evaluation of CNNs)
- **Backbone:** VGG-16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, and a proposed lightweight CNN
- **Loss:** Binary CE loss
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Problem Statement
Evaluating standard deep CNN architectures for the specific task of face anti-spoofing and proposing a more efficient alternative.

## Key Contributions
1.  **Benchmarking:** Evaluated VGG, ResNet, Inception on NUAA.
2.  **Lightweight CNN:** Proposed a smaller architecture that achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters.

## Methodology
### Architecture
- **Fine-tuning:** Transfer learning on standard models.
- **Custom:** Lightweight CNN.

## Experiments
### Datasets Used
- NUAA Photograph Imposter Database

## Critical Analysis
### What Works Well
- Highlighting the trade-off between model size and performance is useful for mobile PAD.

## Relevance to My Work
### Ideas Sparked
- Lightweight models are essential for edge deployment.
