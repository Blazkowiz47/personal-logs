## What does the paper present?
Evaluating standard deep CNN architectures for the specific task of face anti-spoofing and proposing a more efficient alternative.

1.  **Benchmarking:** Evaluated VGG, ResNet, Inception on NUAA.
2.  **Lightweight CNN:** Proposed a smaller architecture that achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters.

## What are my views on it?
- Highlighting the trade-off between model size and performance is useful for mobile PAD.

- Lightweight models are essential for edge deployment.
