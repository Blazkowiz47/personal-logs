## What does the paper present?
Passive FAS methods struggle with complex attacks and generalization. Active methods using specific hardware (IR/Depth) are expensive. This paper proposes a cost-effective active solution using the screen light.

1. **Aurora Guard (AG):** A light reflection-based FAS method that is fast, simple, and effective.
2. **Multi-task CNN:** Recovers subject's depth map and performs light CAPTCHA checking (regression).
3. **Large-scale Dataset:** Collected 12,000 live and spoofing samples with abundant imaging qualities and PAIs.
