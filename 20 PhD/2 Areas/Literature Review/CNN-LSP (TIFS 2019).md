## What does the paper present?
Detecting 3D mask attacks which have realistic depth and texture, making them harder than 2D attacks.

1.  **Deep Dynamic Textures (DDT):** Modeling facial micro-motion as dynamic textures.
2.  **Joint Learning:** Jointly learning spatial and temporal features.
3.  **Discriminative Loss:** Enhancing feature separability.

- 3DMAD

## What are my views on it?
- Focusing on micro-motion (dynamic texture) is effective for 3D masks which might be rigid or move differently than real skin.

- Dynamic texture analysis is a powerful concept for PAD.
