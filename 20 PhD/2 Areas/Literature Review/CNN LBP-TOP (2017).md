## What does the paper present?
Distinguishing between genuine faces and spoofing attacks (print, replay) using both spatial and temporal information.

1.  **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines CNN for spatial feature extraction with LBP-TOP for dynamic texture analysis.
2.  **Dynamic Texture:** Uses LBP-TOP to capture temporal variations in video sequences.

- Likely CASIA-FAS, Replay-Attack (standard for that time).

## What are my views on it?
- Combining deep learning (CNN) with hand-crafted temporal features (LBP-TOP) was a common and effective strategy before full 3D CNNs or RNNs became dominant.

- The concept of explicitly modeling dynamic texture (micro-motions) is still relevant.
