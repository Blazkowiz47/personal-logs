## Quick Summary
**Method:** Dual-modal
- **Backbone:** MoblienetV3
- **Loss:** Binary CE loss
- **Input:** RGB, IR
- **Fusion:** Feature-level

## Abstract
In this paper, we utilize the near-infrared (NIR) and visible light (VIS) modalities to distinguish the living face from the presentation attacks. We explore different dual-modal combination strategies and propose a dual-modal light-weight network based method for face anti-spoofing. We modify the MobileNetV3 to efficiently fuse features from both modalities.
