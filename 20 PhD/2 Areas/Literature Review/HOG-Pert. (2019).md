## Quick Summary
**Method:** HOG-Pert.
- **Backbone:** Multi-scale CNN
- **Loss:** Binary CE loss
- **Input:** RGB+HOG
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Abstract
Perturbing convolutional feature maps with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features is proposed to improve face liveness detection. The method likely enhances the network's focus on texture details and improves generalization by combining handcrafted features with deep learning representations.
