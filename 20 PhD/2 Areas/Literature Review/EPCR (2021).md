## Abstract
Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a crucial role in securing face recognition systems. Empirically, given an image, a model with more consistent output on different views of this image usually performs better. Motivated by this, we conjecture that encouraging feature consistency of different views may be a promising way to boost FAS models. In this paper, we explore this way thoroughly by enhancing both Embedding-level and Prediction-level Consistency Regularization (EPCR) in FAS. Specifically, at the embedding-level, we design a dense similarity loss to maximize the similarities between all positions of two intermediate feature maps in a self-supervised fashion; while at the prediction-level, we optimize the mean square error between the predictions of two views. Notably, our EPCR is free of annotations and can directly integrate into semi-supervised learning schemes.
