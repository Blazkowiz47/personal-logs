## Abstract
This paper proposes a face anti-spoofing user-centered model (FAS-UCM). The major difficulty, in this case, is obtaining fraudulent images from all users to train the models. To overcome this problem, the proposed method is divided in three main parts: generation of new spoof images, based on style transfer and spoof image representation models; training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for liveness detection; evaluation of the live and spoof testing images for each subject. The generalization of the CNN to perform style transfer has shown promising qualitative results.
