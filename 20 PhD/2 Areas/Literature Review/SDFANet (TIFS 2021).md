# Selective Domain-Invariant Feature Alignment Network for Face Anti-Spoofing

> [!abstract]
> One primary challenge in face anti-spoofing refers to suffering a sharp performance drop in cross-domain scenes, where training and testing images are collected from different datasets. Recent methods have achieved promising results by aligning the features of all images among the available source domains. However, due to significant distribution discrepancies among non-face regions of all images, it is challenging to capture domain-invariant features for these regions. In this paper, we propose a novel Selective Domain-Invariant Feature Alignment Network (SDFANet) for cross-domain face anti-spoofing, which aims to align the features of the face regions while ignoring the non-face regions. Specifically, we first introduce a face-aware feature alignment module to align the features of the face regions. Then, we propose a domain-invariant feature learning module to learn the domain-invariant features for the face regions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public face anti-spoofing datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SDFANet.
