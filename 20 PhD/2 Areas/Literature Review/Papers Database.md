## How to Use This Database

1. **Adding a new paper**: Use the Paper Note Template in `/Templates/Paper Note Template.md`
2. **Update status**: Change the status field in the frontmatter to:
   - `ðŸ“š To Read` - Papers in your reading queue
   - `ðŸ“– Reading` - Currently reading
   - `âœ… Read` - Finished reading and summarized
3. **Tag appropriately**: Use relevant tags like #pad, #mad, #deepfake, #multimodal, etc.
4. **Add implementation tag**: Use #to-implement for papers you want to replicate
