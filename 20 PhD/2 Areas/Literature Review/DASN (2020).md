## Quick Summary
**Method:** DASN (Domain-Agnostic Face Anti-Spoofing)
- **Backbone:** ResNet18
- **Loss:** Binary CE & Spoof-irrelevant factor loss (Mutual Information Minimization)
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

## Problem Statement
Poor generalization to unseen domains due to domain-specific factors (identity, pose, illumination).

## Key Contributions
1.  **Spoof-Irrelevant Factor Suppression:** Disentangles spoof-relevant features from irrelevant ones.
2.  **Mutual Information Minimization:** Used to minimize the dependency between learned features and domain factors.

## Methodology
### Architecture
- **Module:** Spoof-irrelevant factor suppression module.

### Key Techniques
- **Disentanglement:** Separating "liveness" from "content/style".

## Experiments
### Datasets Used
- Standard cross-domain benchmarks.

## Critical Analysis
### What Works Well
- Disentanglement is a theoretically sound way to achieve invariance.

## Relevance to My Work
### Ideas Sparked
- Explicitly suppressing irrelevant factors (like identity) is crucial for privacy-preserving PAD as well.
