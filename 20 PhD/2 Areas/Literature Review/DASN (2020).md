## What does the paper present?
- **Backbone:** ResNet18
- **Loss:** Binary CE & Spoof-irrelevant factor loss (Mutual Information Minimization)
- **Input:** RGB
- **Static/Dynamic:** S

Poor generalization to unseen domains due to domain-specific factors (identity, pose, illumination).

1.  **Spoof-Irrelevant Factor Suppression:** Disentangles spoof-relevant features from irrelevant ones.
2.  **Mutual Information Minimization:** Used to minimize the dependency between learned features and domain factors.

- **Module:** Spoof-irrelevant factor suppression module.

- **Disentanglement:** Separating "liveness" from "content/style".

- Standard cross-domain benchmarks.

## What are my views on it?
- Disentanglement is a theoretically sound way to achieve invariance.

- Explicitly suppressing irrelevant factors (like identity) is crucial for privacy-preserving PAD as well.
