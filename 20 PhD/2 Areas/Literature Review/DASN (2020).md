## What does the paper present?
Poor generalization to unseen domains due to domain-specific factors (identity, pose, illumination).

1.  **Spoof-Irrelevant Factor Suppression:** Disentangles spoof-relevant features from irrelevant ones.
2.  **Mutual Information Minimization:** Used to minimize the dependency between learned features and domain factors.

- Standard cross-domain benchmarks.

## What are my views on it?
- Disentanglement is a theoretically sound way to achieve invariance.

- Explicitly suppressing irrelevant factors (like identity) is crucial for privacy-preserving PAD as well.
