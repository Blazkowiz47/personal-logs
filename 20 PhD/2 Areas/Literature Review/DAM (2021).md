## What does the paper present?
Existing FAS datasets are mostly controlled/cooperative. Surveillance scenarios (unconstrained) are under-represented.

1.  **DAM Dataset:** Large-scale multi-modal dataset for surveillance FAS.
2.  **Benchmark:** Evaluates state-of-the-art methods on this challenging data.

- Evaluates various baselines (likely VGG16, TSM as noted in previous version).

- DAM Dataset.

## What are my views on it?
- Surveillance FAS is a huge gap in the literature.

- If I work on surveillance/CCTV PAD, this dataset is essential.
