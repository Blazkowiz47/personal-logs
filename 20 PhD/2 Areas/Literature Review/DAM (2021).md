## Quick Summary
**Method:** DAM (Dataset and Benchmark)
- **Dataset:** DAM (Dataset for Anti-spoofing in Multi-modal surveillance)
- **Modalities:** RGB, Depth, Infrared (IR)
- **Scenario:** Surveillance (low resolution, pose variations, complex lighting)

## Problem Statement
Existing FAS datasets are mostly controlled/cooperative. Surveillance scenarios (unconstrained) are under-represented.

## Key Contributions
1.  **DAM Dataset:** Large-scale multi-modal dataset for surveillance FAS.
2.  **Benchmark:** Evaluates state-of-the-art methods on this challenging data.

## Methodology
### Architecture
- Evaluates various baselines (likely VGG16, TSM as noted in previous version).

## Experiments
### Datasets Used
- DAM Dataset.

## Critical Analysis
### What Works Well
- Surveillance FAS is a huge gap in the literature.

## Relevance to My Work
### Ideas Sparked
- If I work on surveillance/CCTV PAD, this dataset is essential.
