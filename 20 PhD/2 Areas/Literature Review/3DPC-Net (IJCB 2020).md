# Generative VoxelNet: Learning Energy-Based Models for 3D Shape Synthesis and Analysis (3DPC-Net?)

> **Note:** The file name "3DPC-Net" seems to be a mismatch with the paper found at the URL provided (`https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13522`). The paper at this URL is titled **"Generative VoxelNet: Learning Energy-Based Models for 3D Shape Synthesis and Analysis"** and is about 3D shape generation, not explicitly Face Anti-Spoofing.

> **Correction:** I will search for the correct "3DPC-Net" paper (likely "3D Point Cloud Network for Face Anti-Spoofing" from IJCB 2020) in the next step. For now, I am flagging this note as a mismatch.

## What does the paper present?
**(Content below refers to the mismatched VoxelNet paper found at the URL)**
This paper proposes a deep 3D energy-based model to represent volumetric shapes for 3D synthesis and analysis.
