### Summary: Best Face Detector Comparison

- **Purpose**: Determine the best facial detection model for a facial recognition project.
  
#### Key Considerations for Face Detection Models
- **Trade-off**: Accuracy vs. performance.
- **Additional Metrics**: Precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives).
- **Influence of Implementation**: Different implementations and post-processing parameters affect model performance.

#### Models Tested
1. **[[YuNet]] (CPU Model)**
   - **Strengths**: High performance, lightweight, suitable for real-time applications.
   - **Weaknesses**: Struggles with smaller faces.
   - **Conclusion**: Good baseline model for performance-focused applications.

2. **[[Dlib]] (GPU Model)**
   - **Strengths**: Balance of accuracy and performance, good at minimizing false positives.
   - **Weaknesses**: Accuracy significantly depends on upsampling; higher upsampling exceeds GPU memory.
   - **Conclusion**: Useful when minimizing false positives is critical but generally slower.

3. **[[OpenCV DNN]] (GPU Model)**
   - **Strengths**: Very fast.
   - **Weaknesses**: Lower accuracy, tricky setup.
   - **Conclusion**: Limited use cases due to its speed-accuracy trade-off.

4. **[[Pytorch-MTCNN]] (GPU Model)**
   - **Strengths**: Slightly better accuracy than OpenCV DNN.
   - **Weaknesses**: Slower than YuNet, lower overall accuracy.
   - **Conclusion**: No compelling reason to use it over YuNet.

5. **[[RetinaFace]] (GPU Model)**
   - **Strengths**: Highest accuracy, detects even partial and non-human faces, scales well with resolution.
   - **Weaknesses**: Slower, struggles with larger, partially occluded faces.
   - **Conclusion**: Best for accuracy-focused applications but may miss important larger faces.

#### Final Recommendations
- **[[YuNet]]**: For applications prioritizing speed and real-time processing.
- **[[RetinaFace]]**: For applications prioritizing accuracy.
- **[[Dlib]]**: Consider if minimizing false positives is essential.
