# Use of low/high pass filtered images along with rgb images for spoof-detection

## Research Question
Can low-high pass filtered images aid in improving the spoof detection performance?
## Status
ðŸŸ¡ In Progress 

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-10-18
- **Target Completion:** 2025-10-25
- **Milestone Dates:** 

## Motivation
Observation: When we remove 1%, 5% and 20% of the lower frequencies (post fourier transform), the resultant images do contain several camera specific artefacts like blob patterns, and also specifically for screen attacks, the moire-patterns or the grid structure is strikingly visible.

## Hypothesis
Providing the filtered images may aid the deep-learning model to focus on relevant features more compared to simple rgb. 
As [[FMF]] worked good
