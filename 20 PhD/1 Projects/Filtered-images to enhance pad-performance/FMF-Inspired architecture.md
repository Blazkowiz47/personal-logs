# Use of low/high pass filtered images along with rgb images for spoof-detection

## Research Question
*What question are you trying to answer?*
Can low-high pass filtered images aid in improving the spoof detection performance?

## Motivation
Observation: When we remove 1%, 5% and 20% of the lower frequencies (post fourier transform), the resultant images do contain several camera specific artefacts like blob patterns, and also specifically for screen attacks, the moire-patterns or the grid structure is strikingly visible.

## Hypothesis
Providing the filtered images may aid the deep-learning model to focus on relevant features more compared to simple rgb. 
As [[Flexible-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing - A Benchmark|fmf-pad]] worked good in gathering cues from multiple domains, similar strategy should be ideal to make model focus on
