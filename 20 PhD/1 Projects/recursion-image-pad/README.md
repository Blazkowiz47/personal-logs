# recursion-image-pad

Objective
- Explore recursion-based image padding techniques to generate plausible content for missing regions.

Where to find things
- Runs: `runs.md` (qualitative notes + quantitative table)
- Learnings: `learnings.md`
- Bugs: `bugs.md` (checklist-style)
- Artifacts: store externally — put short references/URLs in run entries, not files in this repo
- Tests: none (keep repo lightweight)

Run example
```
python train.py --cfg cfgs/rim.yaml --seed 42
```
