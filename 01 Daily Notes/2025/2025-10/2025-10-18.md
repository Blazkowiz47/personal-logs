## 🔬 PhD Work (8-10 PM)
**Focus:** 
1. For the same vit backbone and then adding attention to the stacked embeddings? kind of like the fmf-pad where instead of different modalities we use different filtered images?  Inputting:
    1. low pass and high pass filtered images
    2. just the fourier transform/wavelet transform images
2. Use HRM type 2 transformer blocks (its initialisation would be from existing clip or dino blocks, or just random weights),
    1. where we perform attention on all the nodes or half of the nodes so there would be 2 streams. Main idea is to have a finegrained and coarse focus on the image.   
    2. applying hrm directly.. assume small number of transfomer blocks like 1 to 3 can do make up the high level and low level module and just make it iterate for small depth values maybe effective depth of 12 (standard vit) to 18 and then use that
3. What if we do the shaprness aware minimization for per domain just like gacd but we adaptively to the minimisation of the crossentropy and contrastive loss? this would basically help us to minimise the prediction’s loss and maximise the clustering of each domains.
