I have been watching this yt video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKyyF9MQXn4&t=1871s by [[Andrew Huberman]]
it talks about several things in physiological aspects.
[[Jack Heldman]], professor at [[UCLA]] on breathing and its efffects.


Few steps to fall into [[Sleep]] a mechanical approach: 
	Neurons responsible for breathing are always active. They work [[unconscious]]ly all the time. 
	But we can take control of them any time as we want.
	Thus, they are sort of a bridge between [[conscious]] and [[unconscious]]  state of the mind.
	Just by deep breathing, the drop in the levels of [[CO2]] reduces stress.
	*There is a link between breathing and state of the mind*
